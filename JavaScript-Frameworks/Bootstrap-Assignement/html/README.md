# Frameworks and Intro to JS Assignment

Created a simple website using bootstrap components for styling
I also added a little bit of styling with an external css file 
to make the website more appealing.


# Navigation Bar

I made the navigation bar using the bootstraps navbar components, as i was learning 
about the navbar styling with bootstrap i saw one of the types of navbar styiling 
called scrollspy which i liked and i implemented in my code making sure i also
implement the navbar-toggler class within the button which will ensure that on smaller
screens on collapse the navbar will be a hamburger menu and compatible with smaller screen
sizes.I used a container-fluid for the navbar.


# Main Content

I styled the main section of the page using the bootstrap component container-fluid to 
ensure that the contents are going to be adapting properly based on the size of the screen.
Each section within the main content was styled with the (class= container) component.



# Form


In the form i made sure to add the validation not only for the required field within the assignement
but to all the fields implementing (class="invalid-feedback") to give user a message on the error 
they are facing while signing up. I used bootstraps grid layout to reach the desired outcome on the
look of the form.


# Table 

I made the table responsive by wrapping it on (class="table-responsive") component with striped and hoverable
rows, also hard-coded user data to simulate submissions 


# Image and Buttons 


I wrapped the images with a (class="container-fluid") then applied the class img-fluid within the img tag to make 
sure that they are compatible with all screen sizes.

I wrapped the buttons in a container just for asthetics i wanted to center them within the page and made sure that 
one of the buttons shows always and the other one is hidden in smaller screens by using the class components d-none
and d-md-block.
