# Module 4 HTML Assignment

On this first assignement i went and did a little bit more than asked when it comes to styling the page externally.
I made a page about a consulting company and their services that they offer

Started off by building a header that includes the site logo and the navigation links which were done by inplementing <ul> the unordered lists

Then i added and image and some preformated text to have a brief history about the company(for this i asked Gemini to make me a short story of a made up consulting company).

I then used the <style> attribute to add some basic style to the images and i left one of the images not styled.

I used semantic elements throughout the page to nest elements in like <section>, <header>, <nav>, <figure> to name a few.

Created a team/members section with images neseted inside <figure> elements

Created a table that has a breakdown of the services they offer and the prices per quantity. With the respectable table headers.

Then finally within the footer i added a contact form and a quick survey with radio buttons. 


The css file i included it might not be as clear but since i only have some basic knowledge in it i still wanted to implement what i know
